<h3><p style="color:orange;">At the airport</p></h3>
<p></p>
Miguel is standing in line at the airport. It is his turn and he walks to the counter. The lady at the counter asks him for his ID and she checks his flight details. Yes, he is confirmed on flight 103 from Los Angeles to Hawaii at noon. He does not have any bags to check in but has one small carry-on bag that he will take with him. The agent prints out his boarding pass. The airport security officers walk past him with a big dog. The dog is sniffing around people’s luggage trying to detect drugs or explosives. Miguel is relieved when he sees the dog walk past him. Suddenly, the dog turns and begins to sniff his bag and bark. The security officer looks at Miguel. “Sir, please bring your bag and come with me.”
